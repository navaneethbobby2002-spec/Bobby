// bootstrapped at module level inside open-sse/translator/index.ts when it
// is first imported. Calling it again from a Next.js Route Handler caused a
// "the worker has exited" uncaughtException crash on Codex CLI requests (#450)
// because the dynamic import runs in a Next.js server worker context where
// certain Node APIs used by the translator bootstrap are not available.
// The translators are always initialized via the open-sse side (chatCore),
// so /v1/responses just delegates to handleChat which handles everything.

 * the CLI sends bare "gpt-5.5" over HTTP after WS closes (1008 Policy), and
 * without this rewrite OmniRoute routes it to openrouter instead of codex.

 * Accepts an optional `preParsedBody` (threaded from withInjectionGuard via #4041)
 * to avoid re-cloning the request when the body was already parsed upstream.
 *
 * Safe: only rewrites when codex/model is genuinely registered; all other models
 * pass through unchanged. Errors are caught and the original request + body are returned.
