-- 155_conversation_turn_nodes.sql
-- Per-turn hash-chain nodes backing a conversation's linear transcript
-- (open-sse/services/conversationTracker.ts). Each row is one distinct
-- turn instance, chained to its predecessor the same way a git commit
-- graph chains commits: id = sha256(parentId ?? conversationId, role,
-- sha256(text)). A request whose turns all match existing nodes just
-- extends the chain; a request whose Nth turn differs from what's on file
-- (a real-world OpenClaw pattern: cache-aware context injection edits/
-- duplicates a turn mid-history to keep provider-side prompt caches warm)
-- becomes its OWN independent conversation instead (2026-08-06 — every
-- OmniRoute conversation is a single straight line, it never forks; see
-- resolveConversationId's doc comment). See agentic_conversations (154) for
-- the conversation-root record; its last_message_count/last_messages_hash
-- columns are superseded by this table and no longer written to.
--
-- content_hash (sha256 of just this turn's own role+text, independent of
-- parent) lets resolveConversationId reconnect from ANY existing node, not
-- only the chain's start: real OpenClaw traffic drops/summarizes the
-- EARLIEST turns as a session grows (a sliding context window), so the turn
-- at index 0 of a new request is often not the chain's first turn at all —
-- a start-only walk would find zero match and mint a spurious new
-- conversation despite a real, unbroken tail overlap.
